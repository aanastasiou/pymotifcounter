# `PGD`

## Obtaining `PGD`

* `> ./fetch_pgd.sh` 
    * Or clone [this repository](https://github.com/nkahmed/PGD)
      in `binaries/pgd/PGD`.

## Compiling `PGD`

* `> cd PGD`
* `> make`

This last step will create the `pgd` executable in the location that 
`pymotifcounter` expects it to be by default (that is `binaries/pgd/PGD/pgd`).
