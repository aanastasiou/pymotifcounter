TODO List as of Wed 24 Nov 10:51:19 UTC 2021
../pymotifcounter/abstractcounter.py:113 TODO: MID, Add a named parameter here to enable saving the ctx variable of a run, down to a file if required.
../pymotifcounter/abstractcounter.py:315 TODO: HIGH, this needs exception handling for timeout
../pymotifcounter/abstractcounter.py:316 TODO: HIGH, if the process returns an error, this error should be piped up as an exception
../pymotifcounter/counter_fanmod.py:15 TODO: MID, The parser --> DataFrame is pretty standard by now, should be incorporated in the standard round-trip
../pymotifcounter/counter_fanmod.py:24 TODO: LOW, Consider abstracting some standard pyparsing definitions as they could be useful for many parsers.
../pymotifcounter/counter_fanmod.py:25 TODO: HIGH, Make sure that the float can parse just integer part too and it becomes "Numeric".
../pymotifcounter/counter_fanmod.py:41 TODO: HIGH, Check which fields are percentages and make sure this is denoted in the output
../pymotifcounter/counter_fanmod.py:65 TODO: LOW, Revise the parser so that it only has one root level.
../pymotifcounter/counter_fanmod.py:71 TODO: HIGH, The conversion can be performed more automatically through pandas rather than a loop
../pymotifcounter/counter_fanmod.py:102 TODO: MID, Give a common name across all inputs and outputs
../pymotifcounter/counter_fanmod.py:103 TODO: MID, Provide a way for parameters to be accessed as attributes or keys and preferably in a unified way
../pymotifcounter/counter_mfinder.py:23 TODO: LOW, Consider abstracting these two somehow as these definitions will be useful for every parser.
../pymotifcounter/counter_mfinder.py:49 TODO: LOW, Revise the parser so that it only has one root level.
../pymotifcounter/counter_mfinder.py:53 TODO: HIGH, The conversion can be performed more automatically through pandas rather than a loop
../pymotifcounter/counter_pgd.py:23 TODO: HIGH, Use float_num to parse the rest of the sections and offer them as additional columns
../pymotifcounter/counter_pgd.py:80 TODO: LOW, Revise the parser so that it only has one root level.
../pymotifcounter/counter_pgd.py:84 TODO: HIGH, The conversion can be performed more automatically through pandas rather than a loop
../pymotifcounter/parameters.py:12 TODO: MID, Check to see if the "directedness" of the algorithm could depend on the networkx.Graph at the input so that the parameter value is set automatically.
